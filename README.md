# Cute-chat-box-for-Twitch

This is the code I use for my Twitch chat!
To use it, simply add the files to Streamlabs by going to Settings > Chat Box > Custom Code. There are three files: one for HTML, one for CSS, and one for JavaScript.

1. HTML goes in the HTML section.
2. CSS goes in the CSS section.
3. JavaScript goes in the JS section.
   
The comments in the code are there to help you understand what each part does.

Hope you enjoy it! <3
